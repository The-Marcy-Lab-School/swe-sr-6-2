# Technical Writing Assignment

For guidance on setting up and submitting this assignment, refer to the Marcy lab School Docs How-To guide for [Working with Short Response and Coding Assignments](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/fullstack-curriculum/how-tos/working-with-assignments#how-to-work-on-assignments).

## Prompt 1

Imagine you are giving a brief lesson on Recursion to a relatively new programmer. In your lesson make sure to include the following:

* A formal definition of recursion (feel free to quote an official source like MDN)
* An example in code.
* An explanation of the code example.
* An explanation of the kinds of functions that are best solved using recursion.

### Response 1

## Prompt 2

Imagine you are giving a brief lesson on the Tree data structure to a relatively new programmer. In your lesson make sure to include the following:

* A formal definition of a Tree (feel free to quote an official source like MDN)
* Definitions for key terms like **root**, **leaf**, **depth**, and **height** as they relate to Trees
* An example in code.
* An explanation of the code example.

### Response 2

## Prompt 3

Any iterative function can be written recursively. Provide an example of an iterative function and the same function written recursively. Then, explain the benefits and/or drawbacks of each approach.

### Response 3

## Prompt 4

Depth-first-search is an algorithm of traversing through a tree that explores as far as possible along a single branch before backtracking and exploring other branches. The three approaches for depth-first-search are "inorder", "preorder", and "postorder". 

Using this tree as an example, explain the differences between these three approaches, providing implementations of each (recursive or iterative, its up to you but one of them is definitely cleaner).

```

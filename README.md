* An example in code.
* An explanation of the code example.
* An explanation of the kinds of functions that are best solved using recursion.

### Response 1

## Prompt 2

Imagine you are giving a brief lesson on the Tree data structure to a relatively new programmer. In your lesson make sure to include the following:

* A formal definition of a Tree (feel free to quote an official source like MDN)
* Definitions for key terms like **root**, **leaf**, **depth**, and **height** as they relate to Trees
* An example in code.
* An explanation of the code example.

### Response 2

## Prompt 3

Any iterative function can be written recursively. Provide an example of an iterative function and the same function written recursively. Then, explain the benefits and/or drawbacks of each approach.

### Response 3

## Prompt 4

Compare and contrast "inorder", "preorder", and "postorder" traversals of a binary tree. You can use this tree as an example:

```
    A
   / \
  B   C
 / \   \
D   E   F
```
